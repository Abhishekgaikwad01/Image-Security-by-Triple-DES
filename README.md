# Image-Security-by-Triple-DES
Project Title:
Image Encryption using Triple DES Algorithm

Objective:
To implement a secure image encryption system using the Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

Key Components:
Image Input:

Accepts a color image in JPEG or PNG format.
Reads image properties such as dimensions and pixel data.
Image Processing:

Converts the image into a one-dimensional byte stream.
Divides the byte stream into fixed-size blocks (8 bytes for Triple DES).
Encryption Algorithm:

Utilizes the Triple DES algorithm to encrypt each block of image data.
Ensures data security by using a secret key for encryption and decryption.
Output:

The encrypted image is saved in a binary format (e.g., .des).
Allows decryption of the encrypted image back to its original form using the same key.
Steps:
Load Image:

Use libraries like PIL to read the image file.
Flatten Image Data:

Convert pixel data into a linear byte stream.
Block Division:

Split the byte stream into blocks of 8 bytes.
Apply padding if necessary to ensure complete blocks.
Encryption:

Encrypt each block using the Triple DES algorithm.
Save Encrypted Image:

Save the encrypted blocks to a file.
Decryption (Optional):

Implement functionality to decrypt the encrypted image back to its original format.
Tools and Libraries:
Python: Programming language for implementation.
PIL (Pillow): Library for image processing.
pycryptodome: Library for cryptographic functions (including Triple DES).
Use Cases:
Secure image storage and transmission in applications requiring confidentiality, such as healthcare, banking, and personal data protection.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of cryptographic algorithms in securing digital images, showcasing the importance of data security in today's digital world.
